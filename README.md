`üÖ±Ô∏èorygon` is a WebSocket client for interacting with [Pok√©mon Showdown](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown). It provides strongly typed messages for the Pok√©mon Showdown messages it supports.  It vends two clients:

- `RawShowdownClient`: A thin wrapper around `ws` that parses incoming Pok√©mon Showdown messages and exposes them through an event emitter.
- `ManagedShowdownClient`: A more feature-rich wrapper around `RawShowdownClient` that provides more features like retries and convenience functions for logging into Pok√©mon Showdown

## Project Status
`üÖ±Ô∏èorygon` supports the vast majority of Pok√©mon Showdown messages with an emphasis on supporting events still actively used by Pok√©mon Showdown and also tries to support older, deprecated messages whenever possible. Through live testing (connecting a bot to several of Pok√©mon Showdown's public chat rooms and public battles and deserializing/serializing all incoming messages), 99.9999% of messages are accurately handled. Despite this high rate of support, the project will remain below `1.0.0` until:

- all current message types are supported
- all messages types have unit tests
- a canary-like system is implemented to determine if there are any new message usages that break this client's expectations
- full documentation of all public functions and types (especially message types)

`üÖ±Ô∏èorygon` can be adopted and should, but care should be taken to handle errors whenever possible as there will likely always be situations that `üÖ±Ô∏èorygon` does not handle properly with older messages in replays or new Pok√©mon Showdown functionality that hasn't been imlemented yet.

### Planned Features
1. A more battle-oriented client that handles similar logic for reading messages and determining the state of a battle, similar to what the Pok√©mon Showdown client does
2. A convenience tool for parsing replays
3. Ability to override and extend supported message types without modifying source
4. Ability to tune level of runtime typechecking
